### Project Template

### Project Title TBD.
  Ideas pending and brainstorming is under way.

### Pitch

It is a 2D unity game, all hand drawn art and a unique platofrmer. Indie games are so hot right now.

### Problem

Not really a 'problem' that is being solved, I am just trying to create a fun product and to showcase my skills. Will be solving many problems in the process of working on the project though. Will have to tackle learning Unity, possibly some C# and bringing all the art and assets successfully into the project. 

### Solution

I will solve these problems by using extensive tutorials and lessons on Lynda and Youtube. Patience, perseverance and hard work will play a large part. 

### Target Audience

Myself and any other individuals with an appreciation for games made with love and an attention to detail. Also I hope the animation stlye will be quite unique with my brother contributing that piece. [See his art here](https://www.instagram.com/h0ll0wb0nes)
